# PRD Generator Security Requirements

## 1. Authentication and Authorization
- All API endpoints must be protected with JWT authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with at least three roles: Admin, Manager, User
- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 10
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Implement password complexity requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

## 2. Data Protection
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Implement database row-level security for PRD access
- All data in transit must use TLS 1.3 or higher
- Implement proper data masking for sensitive information in logs

## 3. Input Validation
- All user inputs must be validated using Joi schema validation
- Implement maximum length limits for all text inputs
- Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP)

## 4. API Security
- Implement API versioning (v1)
- Use HATEOAS for REST API responses
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- All API responses must include proper security headers:
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Content-Security-Policy

## 5. Error Handling
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Implement proper error logging with stack traces
- Use generic error messages for public API responses
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external service calls

## 6. Session Management
- Use secure session cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- Implement session regeneration after successful login
- Maximum session duration of 24 hours
- Implement session invalidation on password change

## 7. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement structured logging using Winston
- Log all security-relevant events:
  - Login attempts (success/failure)
  - Password changes
  - Role changes
  - Failed API requests
- Implement log rotation with maximum 30 days retention
- Monitor for suspicious activities:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Unusual API request patterns
  - Large data transfers

## 8. External Integrations
- Validate OAuth tokens from external services
- Implement proper error handling for external service failures
- Cache external service responses with proper TTL
- Implement circuit breaker for external service calls

## 9. Code Quality
- Implement ESLint with security rules
- Use SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Implement proper error handling patterns
- Follow secure coding practices:
  - No hard-coded credentials
  - No direct SQL queries
  - No eval() usage
  - No unsafe deserialization

## 10. Security Testing
- Implement automated security testing using OWASP ZAP
- Conduct regular security audits
- Test for common vulnerabilities:
  - XSS
  - CSRF
  - SQL Injection
  - Authentication bypass
  - Authorization bypass

## 11. Backup and Recovery
- Implement automated database backups
- Test backup restoration process
- Store backups in secure, encrypted storage
- Maintain at least 30 days of backup history

## 12. Compliance
- Follow GDPR requirements for user data
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Provide data export functionality for users
- Maintain security audit logs for 90 days

## 13. Security Updates
- Implement automated dependency updates
- Regular security patching of dependencies
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities
- Maintain a security changelog

## 14. Security Training
- Provide security training for developers
- Document security best practices
- Maintain security documentation
- Regular security awareness updates

## 15. Emergency Response
- Implement incident response plan
- Define security escalation procedures
- Maintain security contact information
- Document security breach procedures
